# GameCo's 2017 Market Strategy: A Global Video Game Sales Analysis

**GameCo, a hypothetical video game company, is seeking a comprehensive analysis of global sales to shape its 2017 marketing strategy.**

## Purpose
**This analysis aims to provide insights beyond budget allocation. GameCo is looking to understand market dynamics, including trends in game popularity, competitive landscape, and regional sales patterns. Contrary to the company's belief that regional sales have been consistent, this study will verify that assumption and delve deeper into factors like genre preferences, leading publishers, and favored gaming platforms.**

## Data Source
**The data for this study comes from [VGChartz](https://www.vgchartz.com/), encompassing physical game sales data from 1980 to 2016.
